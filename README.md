# musicPlayer
The app reads all your MP3 files on a given directory taking the following metadata:
* title
* artist
* album
* album art

They will be displayed on a list and can be played by clicking on top of them. They can then be ordered by title, artist, album, modify date and duration;  ascending or descending.

Songs can be played randomly and on ended can be configured to repeat the song, play the next one (random if enabled) or do nothing.

Here can be seen an image with some songs loaded and one playing:
